# 🌐 My First Web Design Project: A Simple HTML & CSS Creation!

Hey there! 👋  
Welcome to my very first web design project — built in 04/02/2025 - entirely from scratch using just **HTML** and **CSS**. This is where my journey into the world of web development began, and I’m super excited to share it with you! 🚀

## ✨ What This Project Is

This project is a clean and simple web page that reflects my early learning in web design. It’s all about understanding how to structure content with HTML and make it look good using CSS.

Throughout this build, I picked up some essential web dev skills:

- **HTML Structure**: Using semantic tags to organize content meaningfully  
- **CSS Styling**: Playing with colors, fonts, spacing, layout, and responsiveness  
- **Problem-Solving**: Figuring things out as I go, fixing bugs, and refining design choices
